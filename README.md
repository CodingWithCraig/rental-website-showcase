# Rental Paradise ðŸŒ´

**Rental Paradise** is a web project fully built and designed by **Craig Hlongwani**.
The website was developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and is hosted through **AWS services**.

It is **live and fully functional**, featuring:

* A **login page** for user access
* **Input responsiveness** for smooth performance across all devices
* A **search functionality** for easy property browsing
* **Beautiful animations** that enhance the overall user experience

Though this is my **first big project**, I consider it my **first major success** â€” a milestone in my journey as a web developer. More creative and advanced projects are on the way!

> **Note:** The project is **not yet finished**. I plan to **continue improving and updating** it to ensure that users always have a great and satisfying experience.
